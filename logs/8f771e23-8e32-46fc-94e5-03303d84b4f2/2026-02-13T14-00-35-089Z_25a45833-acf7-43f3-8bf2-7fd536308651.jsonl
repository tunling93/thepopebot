[Premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") trading indicates a continuation of the previous day's sharp sell-off, with futures for the [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\"), [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all pointing to a negative start to the trading session.\n\n## Premarket Pulse and Index Overview\n\nIn [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") trading, futures for the S&P 500 were down less than 0.1%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also edged 0.1% lower. Nasdaq futures signaled a weaker open as well, reflecting the ongoing pressure on technology-related stocks. This follows a turbulent session on Thursday where the S&P 500 plunged 1.6%, its second-worst day since Thanksgiving. The Dow shed 1.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2%.\n\nThe current market sentiment is being heavily influenced by a significant rotation away from technology stocks. Concerns are mounting that the rapid advancements in AI could disrupt existing business models, leading to a reassessment of valuations for many software and tech companies. This has led to a notable divergence in performance, with the equal-weighted S&P 500 outperforming its market-cap-weighted counterpart, which is heavily skewed towards large-cap tech.\n\n## Upcoming Market Catalysts\n\nInvestors are keenly awaiting the release of the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which is expected to provide further insights into the trajectory of inflation. Economists are forecasting a cooling in the annual inflation rate to around 2.5%, which would bring it closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This data will be a critical input for the central bank's future monetary policy decisions. Currently, market expectations are overwhelmingly in favor of the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady at its next meeting.\n\nLooking ahead, traders should also note that U.S. markets will be closed on Monday, February 16th, for Presidents' Day.\n\n## Movers and Shakers in the News\n\nThe apprehension around AI's impact has been particularly evident in the performance of several major technology companies. Cisco Systems ([CSCO](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/CSCO)) saw its shares sink by 12.3% despite reporting quarterly results that beat expectations, as investors fretted about its future profitability in the age of AI. Similarly, AppLovin ([APP](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/APP)), a mobile technology company, experienced a staggering 19.7% plunge in its stock price due to worries that AI could undercut its business, even as it posted strong quarterly profits.\n\nThe broader technology sell-off has impacted a wide range of software stocks. In contrast, some non-technology companies have shown resilience. McDonald's ([MCD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MCD)) rose 2.7% after reporting better-than-expected profits, and Walmart ([WMT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WMT)) also saw its shares rally.\n\nIn other corporate news, BridgeBio Pharma Inc. ([BBIO](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/BBIO)) announced positive results from a late-stage study of its experimental drug for a form of dwarfism. On the other hand, investment research firm Zacks has added Kirby ([KEX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/KEX)) and Mattel ([MAT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MAT)) to its \"Strong Sell\" list, citing downward revisions to their earnings estimates. As the market navigates these crosscurrents, the focus will remain on the interplay between technological disruption and macroeconomic data.\n\n2h ago • Updated: 2/13/2026 7:07 AM\n\n### Live Updates\n\n🔔 New updates available\n\nChecking for updates...

Our baseline expectation is for firm growth ahead, and with the federal funds rate now aligned with a range of neutral estimates, we expect the Federal Reserve to become more cautious about easing. (The neutral rate is the interest rate that would neither stimulate nor restrict economic activity.)\n\nU.S. economic momentum continues to be anchored by robust capital outlays, which have played a central role in driving growth over the past year. We expect business investment to remain a major source of strength in 2026. A significant part of this support comes from the rapid expansion of AI‑related spending, which we estimate to still be in the early stages.\n\nRecent data have provided positive signs of continued disinflation. Some modest tariff-related impacts will still likely filter through early this year, and we expect core inflation to crest slightly above 3% before easing later in the year.\n\nJob creation has cooled considerably over the past year. Even so, we believe the underlying labor backdrop remains stable. We assess that demographic dynamics and immigration flows explain about 70% of a recent hiring slowdown, rather than a deterioration in labor demand. We see the unemployment rate firming toward 4.2% by the end of 2026.\n\n## United States economic forecasts\n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: Trump Oversells Recent U.S. Economic Growth - FactCheck.org\nLink: https://www.factcheck.org/2026/02/trump-oversells-recent-u-s-economic-growth/\nAge: 20 hours ago\nSnippet: <strong>In the second and third quarters of 2025, the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in two years</strong>.

Those growth rates were not “numbers unheard of,” or figures the U.S. “never had” before, as President Donald Trump has claimed.\n\nIn addition, economic experts told us that federal data do not support Trump’s claim that there was economic “stagflation” during the Biden administration and “the complete opposite” during Trump’s first year back in office. Inflation was high during much of Joe Biden’s presidency, but economic growth was not stagnant, another key indicator of stagflation, the experts said. \n\nThey also said that Trump’s tariff policies likely hindered economic growth, rather than helped spur it, as the president has suggested. \n\nTrump made those claims while touting the U.S. economy in recent speeches and remarks, as well as in a late January opinion piece written for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nDuring a Jan. 27 [speech](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-economy-energy-clive-iowa-january-27-2026/) in Iowa, Trump said, “So, under my leadership, economic growth is exploding to numbers unheard of. They’ve never had them before.”\n\nHe later said in [an interview](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-tom-llamas-nbc-news-february-4-2026/#365) with NBC News on [Feb. 4](https://youtu.be/rT6eucDVmFY?si=ruC7Zho8b2Zj1sKU&t=16), “We have low inflation and we have tremendous growth. You haven’t had these numbers like this.”\n\nAnd when claiming to have achieved “unprecedented” growth numbers in a Jan. 29 Cabinet [meeting](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-remarks-cabinet-meeting-january-29-2026/) at the White House, Trump said that if not for the [43-day](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/11/12/congress/trump-signs-bill-ending-longest-government-shutdown-in-us-history-00650189) federal government shutdown last fall, **“**we would have picked up about a point and a half more than \\[the\\] already high numbers, record setting numbers.”\n\nWhile the U.S. economy grew significantly in the second and third quarters of 2025, [according to](https://perma.cc/9DQR-APL2) the most recent data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the numbers did not set records, as Trump claimed.\n\nAfter declining by an annualized rate of [0.6%](https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2026-01/gdp3q25-updated.pdf) in the first quarter of 2025, which covers the three months from January to March, real gross domestic product (meaning it has been adjusted for inflation) grew at an annualized rate of 3.8% in the second quarter of 2025 and at a rate of 4.4% in the third quarter.

But the data also had revised figures that paint an even weaker picture of last year’s performance. It comes as some corporations like Amazon and UPS are announcing layoffs. Geoff Bennett discussed more with Harry Holzer, a former chief economist for the Department of Labor.\n\n_Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors._\n\n**Amna Nawaz:**\n\nThe U.S. economy opened 2026 on better footing, with the latest jobs report showing employers added 130,000 jobs in January. And the unemployment rate edged down to 4.3 percent from 4.4 percent in December, a stronger-than-expected result for last month.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nBut the data also had newly revised figures that paint an even weaker picture of last year's performance. The U.S. economy added just 181,000 net jobs last year, about 400,000 fewer than initially reported, and far from the 1.4 million jobs added in 2024.\n\nThis all comes as some corporations like Amazon and UPS are announcing tens of thousands of layoffs.\n\nTo break down all these numbers. And what it all means for the U.S. economy, we're joined now by Harry Holzer, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University. He's a former chief economist for the Department of Labor.\n\nThanks for being here. We appreciate it.\n\nHarry Holzer, Professor of Public Policy, Georgetown University: Thank you. Nice to be here.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nSo we should say 130,000 jobs added is not a strong number. Not long ago, that number would have been reported as underwhelming. Why have the goalposts shifted?\n\n**Harry Holzer:**\n\nWell, because job growth all of last year was so weak. So compared to a lot of the weakness we saw in 2025, 130,000 is a pretty good number.\n\nSo relative to that. But another misleading thing about that, and this has been true for a while, almost all of the job creation is limited to a few key sectors, like health care, social assistance, and, this month, construction and professional services. There were other sectors that actually had job loss.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nAnd what are those? What sectors remain under pressure?\n\n**Harry Holzer:**\n\nLast month, we saw declines in information technology, in financial services, and continuing declines in the federal government, federal government because of DOGE activities and other cutbacks. Federal government shed about 300,000 workers last year.\n\nThey dropped another 33,000 to 34,000 last month.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nAnd the revisions to last year's numbers are also striking. Just 181,000 jobs were added in 2025. That's about 14 percent of the gains that we saw in 2024. What does that say about the underlying strength of the economy?\n\n**Harry Holzer:**\n\nWell, the economy weakened in 2025. There was so much uncertainty. The policy environment was so chaotic, tariffs and immigration cuts and things like that. I think employers face less consumer demand in the market, and they just had so much uncertainty about what was going to happen month to month that they cut way back.\n\nOf course, the other factor was less immigrant -- fewer immigrants coming into the market, and therefore fewer workers available for being hired.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nAnd there's been a surge in corporate layoffs, as we mentioned. The global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released a report that said layoffs were 118 percent higher compared with January of 2025.\n\nWhat kind of warning sign does that send? Or is this a normalization after pandemic era overexpansion?\n\n**Harry Holzer:**\n\nI think, for the tech sector, for companies like Amazon, some of it is normalization and that's been going on for a few years already. But some of it is they have invested very heavily in A.I. with the idea that they're going to -- that's going to save them on labor costs and they want to start seeing the returns on that investment.\n\nSo they're announcing some cutbacks. More broadly, we're not seeing an enormous number of layoffs, but they are a bit higher, certainly relative to a year ago and even relative to last month. You see some uptick in layoffs. Most of the decline has been new hiring, rather than layoffs, but it's something to keep an eye on.\n\n**Geoff Bennett:**\n\nYes. You could argue we're not in a recession, but for a lot of workers and Americans generally, it might feel like one.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the former Fed economist, she noted that the 181,000 jobs you mentioned earlier in an economy of 158 million is basically nothing. And then you have the Fed Governor Chris Waller -- he's a Trump appointee -- he mentioned in his dissent that the recent payroll gains do not remotely look like a healthy labor market.\n\nIs this a cyclical cooling or is something more structural happening beneath the surface here?\n\n**Harry Holzer:**\n\nWe're not sure yet. And that's why from one month to the next, we keep watching\n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: U.S. Hiring Starts the Year at a Strong Pace - The New York Times\nLink: https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/02/11/business/jobs-report-economy\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: <strong>The unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent and the economy added 130,000 jobs in January</strong>.

South Korean shares hit an all-time high fueled by the global surge in AI-driven chip demand, while Singaporean stocks surpassed the 5,000-point mark as capital flowed into diversified sectors beyond technology. Consequently, the MSCI index of emerging Asian equities climbed roughly 0.7% to a new peak, anchored by a 3% record-breaking surge in the KOSPI.\n\nThe semiconductor industry acted as a primary engine for these gains. Major players Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix saw their share prices jump by 6.4% and 3.3%, respectively, propelling the South Korean benchmark upward for the fourth day in a row.\n\nIn Japan, the financial landscape saw a rare synchronized rally of stocks, government bonds, and the yen as investors reacted to Sanae Takaichi’s historic election as Prime Minister. The Nikkei 225 broke the 58,000 threshold for the first time, hitting an intraday record of 58,015.08 before cooling off to close slightly lower at 57,639.84. Despite the late-day dip, the index has gained nearly 15% so far in 2026, while the broader Topix index rose 0.7% to settle at 3,882.16.\n\nCorporate performance within Japan remained a mixed bag. Shiseido experienced its largest stock surge since 2008 climbing 15.8% on the news of a projected return to profitability.\n\nConversely, Honda Motor saw its shares drop 3.5% following a weak earnings report. Market attention is now shifting toward SoftBank Group, which is expected to release results that clarify the financing strategy for its ambitious AI investment portfolio.\n\n**Most Read:** [**Chart alert: Nikkei 225 bullish acceleration intact towards 60,000 in the first step**](https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/chart-alert-nikkei-225-bullish-acceleration-intact-towards-60000-in-the-first-step/)\n\n## European Session - European shares advance on earnings\n\nEuropean equity markets climbed to unprecedented heights on Thursday, spearheaded by a rally in French benchmarks as a string of upbeat corporate earnings reports bolstered confidence.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 edged up 0.7% to reach 625.86 points, while the CAC 40 outpaced its peers with a gain of more than 1.4%.\n\nSpecific corporate success stories drove much of the morning's momentum. Shares of Legrand rose 3.3% following the company's announcement that the booming data center market is fueling its expansion, allowing for an upward revision of its medium-term profitability goals. Similarly, luxury powerhouse Hermes saw its stock climb 2.3% after reporting consistent revenue growth, underpinned by robust consumer demand in both Japan and the United States.\n\nBroader market sentiment was further supported by a sense of international relief. Investors reacted positively to recent US labor data, which indicated a resilient job market, effectively overshadowing recent anxieties regarding AI-driven market volatility. This shift in focus allowed equities to regain their footing after several sessions of uncertainty.\n\nMerger and acquisition activity provided an additional jolt to the financial sector. Shares of British money manager Schroders skyrocketed 30% after US-based Nuveen announced an agreement to acquire the firm for £9.9 billion ($13.5 billion). The deal, which creates a combined entity managing nearly $2.5 trillion in assets, pushed the broader financial services sector up by 1.4%, making it the day's top-performing industry group.\n\nOn the FX front, the Japanese yen surged on Thursday, positioning itself for its most significant weekly gain in over a year. This resurgence has placed notable pressure on the US dollar, signaling a potential sentiment shift in global currency markets.\n\nThe yen climbed approximately 2.8% against the greenback and over 2% against the euro this week. While the dollar index edged slightly lower.\n\nIn other regions, the Australian dollar reached a three-year peak of $0.7146. This rally follows a series of interest rate hikes by the central bank, which has signaled that more tightenin\n\n--- Result 2 ---\nTitle: Stock markets today, Asia continues to lead the way with new records in Seoul.

Track the gold spot price in GBP, USD, EUR, JPY, AUD, CAD &amp; CHF &gt;&gt;\nContent:\nBullionVault's gold price chart shows you the current price of gold in the professional gold bullion market.\n\nWe give you the fastest updates online, with the live gold price data processed about every 10 seconds. There is no need to refresh your browser. This chart also gives you up to 20 years of historical data, so you can see the long-term gold price trends. Live and historic data is available in seven different currencies.\n\nYou can then use those real-time spot prices to place an order using BullionVault's live order board, selecting your gold market from Zurich, London, New York, Toronto or Singapore.\n\nOn BullionVault you can buy [gold](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-guide/gold) in US Dollars, Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen.\n\n| | Gold Spot Price Today |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gold Price per Gram |   |   |   |\n| Gold Price per Kilo |   |   |   |\n| Gold Price per Ounce |   |   |   |\n|   |\n\n| Gold Price Last |\n| --- |\n| Current Price | |\n| High | |\n| Low | |\n| Change | |\n\nThis gold price chart is a live feed of the spot price in the wholesale market. It closes over the weekend and public holidays. BullionVault, on the other hand, never shuts. It allows you to trade gold 24 hours a day, every day of the year.\n\nSet a custom [gold price alert](https://www.bullionvault.com/price-alerts.do) on the website or app to be emailed or notified whenever the gold price moves through your chosen value.\n\nYes, BullionVault gives you direct access to wholesale gold, silver, platinum and palladium at live professional-market prices, starting from as little as 1 gram at a time.\n\nIt's important to understand that the spot price shown above on BullionVault's chart is provided for reference. Like the spot price published by other sources (such as Reuters or Bloomberg) it represents the average of many wholesale quotes, and – crucially – it represents the average of those quotes' mid-points.\n\nSpot, in other words, doesn't necessarily reflect a price you might actually get from any individual bank or dealer, and it cannot reflect the spread between prices to buy and prices to sell.\n\nFor private investors, only BullionVault gives you direct access to that trading spread, enabling you to set or accept prices as you choose using our live [Order Board](https://www.bullionvault.com/order-board.do).\n\nYou will benefit from the lowest costs for buying, selling and storing gold. You can also calculate commission and gold storage fees using our [cost calculator](https://www.bullionvault.com/cost-calculator.do)\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is determined by London's biggest bullion banks, who agree on a price to clear their outstanding client and inhouse orders at a fixed time each day. The London Bullion Market Association publishes this price on its website.\n\nThe price is determined on UK working weekdays at 3pm London time for gold (midday for silver, 2pm for platinum and palladium). The prices are made public at midnight. Orders are processed shortly after the price is determined using a provisional, estimated price, and then adjusted to the published price on the following working day. Place your order for gold by 2:35pm to secure the daily price shown (11:40am for silver, 1:35pm for platinum and palladium).\n\nNo Daily Price is published on Saturday and Sunday, or on certain UK public holidays.\n\nYes. Ordering at the [Daily Price](https://www.bullionvault.com/daily-price.do) is an easy way to buy and sell gold. Tell us how much you want to trade and we'll do the rest for you.\n\nThe actual bullion and cash normally take two working days to settle to your account. For a purchase, your funds stay in your account and are reserved until the bullion is settled. Likewise for a sale, the bullion you are selling is reserved in your account until you receive the cash, typically after two working days.\n\nOpen orders are only executed on days when an appropriate gold price is published.\n\nThe Daily Price of gold is published in troy ounces in US Dollars, Euros and British Pounds (1 troy oz = 0.0311034768 kg). On BullionVault, you place orders in kilograms. We convert the as-published price of gold per ounce to a price of gold per kg and round up to the nearest Dollar, Euro or Pound. We use the same gold price per kg for buying and for selling with no spread.\n\nMany factors impact the changing price of gold, including supply and demand, central bank monetary policy, inflation and the performance of stock markets and bonds.\n\nArticles and analysis exploring gold and its relationship with the financial markets are published on BullionVault's [Gold News](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news) each day. Additionally, once you open a BullionVault account, you can opt-in to receive the [Weekly Market Update](https://www.bullionvault.com/info/weekly-update).

The real estate sector also suffered after some comments from Elon Musk about sending it into space.\n\nAdditionally, a Russian memo hints at more collaboration between the country and the US related to energy and minerals, and even the possibility of Russia returning to the USD system.\n\nFinally, the solid United States (US) Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report came back to play. The upbeat figures boosted the USD temporarily, but without some additional help, the Greenback had no room to run. The latest catalyst added to the USD bullish case was triggered on Wednesday by the NFP report.\n\nMarket players are also awaiting the release of the US January Consumer Price Index (CPI). Inflation is foreseen as mixed, with expectations of steady 0.3% monthly inflation and a modest yearly downtick expected, which cannot really affect future [Federal Reserve](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) decisions.\n\nBack to Gold, the bright metal is incapable of benefiting from the risk-averse environment; volatility around the bright metal, however, is high, with the price now trading over $70,00 above the intraday low.\n\n### XAU/USD short-term technical outlook\n\n![Chart Analysis XAU/USD](https://www.fxstreet.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Feditorial.fxsstatic.com%2Fmiscelaneous%2Fchart-analysis-1770915633053&w=1536&q=95)\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the 4-hour chart for XAU/USD shows the risk skewed to the downside. The 20‑period Simple Moving Average (SMA) has started to flatten after a steady climb, remaining above the slower 100‑ and 200‑period SMAs. Price sits below the 20 and 100 SMAs, providing resistance in the $5,012.12 - $5,049.90 band, while the 200 SMA offers dynamic support at $4,769.06. At the same time, technical indicators turned sharply bearish, heading south almost vertically within negative levels, reflecting mounting selling pressure.\n\nIn the daily chart, XAU/USD briefly pierced the bullish 20-day SMA before recovering above it, but remains nearby, with the SMA currently at $4,952.06. The longer moving averages are still too far below the shorter one to be relevant, while maintaining their upward slopes. Finally, the Momentum indicator is piercing its midline, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator also turned lower, currently standing at 53, both suggesting lower lows ahead.\n\n_(The technical analysis of this story was written with the help of an AI tool.)_\n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: Gold Price per Ounce in US Dollar (USD) Today\nLink: https://goldpricez.com/\nAge: 1 hour ago\nSnippet: Live Gold Price per Ounce in USD.

[Premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") trading indicates a continuation of the previous day's sharp sell-off, with futures for the [S&P 500](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/sp500/ \"snp500 today\"), [Dow Jones](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/dowjones/today.aspx \"Dow Jones Today\") Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all pointing to a negative start to the trading session.\n\n## Premarket Pulse and Index Overview\n\nIn [premarket](https://stockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/ \"Premarket Movers\") trading, futures for the S&P 500 were down less than 0.1%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also edged 0.1% lower. Nasdaq futures signaled a weaker open as well, reflecting the ongoing pressure on technology-related stocks. This follows a turbulent session on Thursday where the S&P 500 plunged 1.6%, its second-worst day since Thanksgiving. The Dow shed 1.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2%.\n\nThe current market sentiment is being heavily influenced by a significant rotation away from technology stocks. Concerns are mounting that the rapid advancements in AI could disrupt existing business models, leading to a reassessment of valuations for many software and tech companies. This has led to a notable divergence in performance, with the equal-weighted S&P 500 outperforming its market-cap-weighted counterpart, which is heavily skewed towards large-cap tech.\n\n## Upcoming Market Catalysts\n\nInvestors are keenly awaiting the release of the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which is expected to provide further insights into the trajectory of inflation. Economists are forecasting a cooling in the annual inflation rate to around 2.5%, which would bring it closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This data will be a critical input for the central bank's future monetary policy decisions. Currently, market expectations are overwhelmingly in favor of the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady at its next meeting.\n\nLooking ahead, traders should also note that U.S. markets will be closed on Monday, February 16th, for Presidents' Day.\n\n## Movers and Shakers in the News\n\nThe apprehension around AI's impact has been particularly evident in the performance of several major technology companies. Cisco Systems ([CSCO](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/CSCO)) saw its shares sink by 12.3% despite reporting quarterly results that beat expectations, as investors fretted about its future profitability in the age of AI. Similarly, AppLovin ([APP](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/APP)), a mobile technology company, experienced a staggering 19.7% plunge in its stock price due to worries that AI could undercut its business, even as it posted strong quarterly profits.\n\nThe broader technology sell-off has impacted a wide range of software stocks. In contrast, some non-technology companies have shown resilience. McDonald's ([MCD](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MCD)) rose 2.7% after reporting better-than-expected profits, and Walmart ([WMT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/WMT)) also saw its shares rally.\n\nIn other corporate news, BridgeBio Pharma Inc. ([BBIO](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/BBIO)) announced positive results from a late-stage study of its experimental drug for a form of dwarfism. On the other hand, investment research firm Zacks has added Kirby ([KEX](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/KEX)) and Mattel ([MAT](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock/MAT)) to its \"Strong Sell\" list, citing downward revisions to their earnings estimates. As the market navigates these crosscurrents, the focus will remain on the interplay between technological disruption and macroeconomic data.\n\n2h ago • Updated: 2/13/2026 7:07 AM\n\n### Live Updates\n\n🔔 New updates available\n\nChecking for updates...

U.S. January CPI came in softer than forecast at <strong>+2.4% year-over-year</strong>\nContent:\n![US CPI Today [Live] Updates](https://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/12203502/How-Will-Bitcoin-Price-React-to-CPI-News_-Key-Details-for-Crypto-Investors.webp)\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 13:33:34 UTC\n\n## **CPI Cooler Than Expected: Rate Cuts in Sight?**\n\nU.S. January CPI came in softer than forecast at +2.4% year-over-year (consensus: +2.5%), with monthly headline at +0.2% (vs. +0.3%). Core CPI ex-food/energy matched expectations at +0.3% monthly. The downside surprise fuels bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts as early as March, boosting risk assets. Bitcoin surged 3% post-release, signaling renewed optimism for crypto amid easing inflation pressures. Markets eye next week’s FOMC for clues.\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 13:07:23 UTC\n\n## Bitcoin Caught Between Key Liquidation Zones\n\nBitcoin is trading between two major liquidity areas. On the upside, a heavy cluster of short liquidations sits between $69,000 and $74,000. A move into this zone could trigger forced buying and accelerate momentum. On the downside, a strong pocket of long liquidations rests between $64,000 and $66,000. A drop into that range may spark quick selling pressure as positions get wiped out.\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 12:27:03 UTC\n\n## Bitcoin Records One of Its Biggest Capitulation Events\n\nBitcoin has just gone through one of the largest capitulation events in its history, according to data from CryptoQuant. The latest sell-off ranks among the top three to five biggest realized loss events ever recorded.The scale of losses is being compared to the 2021 market crash, showing widespread panic selling. In past cycles, such major capitulations have often signaled late-stage fear before market stabilization.\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 11:51:22 UTC\n\n## January CPI Key for Fed Rate Outlook\n\nThe January Consumer Price Index (CPI) will play a key role in shaping expectations around interest rates. Markets expect inflation to slow to around 2.5% year-on-year. However, despite the projected cooling, futures data suggests the chances of an immediate rate cut from the Federal Reserve remain low for now.\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 11:47:50 UTC\n\n## CPI Data Release Today, Markets Brace for Volatility\n\nThe January inflation report lands Friday morning, and traders are treating it like a key policy event. CPI is expected at 2.5% year-on-year, which would bring inflation back to May 2025 levels despite tariff measures introduced under Donald Trump. A softer reading could lift rate-cut hopes and support Bitcoin and broader crypto. But a hotter print may push the dollar and yields higher, putting pressure on risk assets.\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 11:47:50 UTC\n\n## **January CPI Report Today: Headline Seen Cooling, Core Inflation Picks Up**\n\nWall Street expects a mixed inflation report for January. Headline CPI is projected at 0.26% month-on-month and 2.5% year-on-year, slightly lower than December’s 0.31% and 2.7%.However, core CPI is expected to rise 0.34% monthly, up from 0.24% in December, though the yearly rate may ease to 2.5%. Forecasts for core remain widely split, showing uncertainty around seasonal effects and tariff-related price pressures.\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 11:43:14 UTC\n\n## **Oil Trend Signals January CPI May Come in Higher**\n\nThere’s a simple way to gauge where inflation may head. When oil prices fall compared to the previous month, CPI usually comes in lower than expected. When oil prices rise, inflation tends to surprise on the upside. Since oil prices increased in January, the upcoming CPI report is likely to show higher-than-expected inflation, which could impact market sentiment.\n\n### Trust with CoinPedia:\n\nCoinPedia has been delivering accurate and timely cryptocurrency and blockchain updates since 2017.

But since June 2022, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) hit its highest level in 40 years (9.1%!) and the Federal Reserve hiked [interest rates](https://www.kiplinger.com/economic-forecasts/interest-rates) to their highest level in over 20 years, more folks have become interested in the data.\n\nThis is because inflation is a measure of our purchasing power. How much things cost and how quickly prices are rising directly impacts not only how far a dollar will stretch for us, but also how far it will go for the companies that we invest in. And very few things make the stock market grumpier than a disappointing profit margin.\n\nThat's why the January CPI report, due out ahead of this Friday's open, is one of the most-anticipated events on this week's [economic calendar](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/economy/this-weeks-economic-calendar).\n\n## From just ~$107.88~ $24.99 for Kiplinger Personal Finance\n\nBecome a smarter, better informed investor.

In December, headline inflation was up 2.7% year over year and core inflation was 2.6% higher.\n\n\"Energy prices rose a tad because of a jump in natural gas service,\" writes [David Payne](https://www.kiplinger.com/author/david-payne), staff economist and reporter for The Kiplinger Letter, in the [Kiplinger Inflation Outlook](https://www.kiplinger.com/economic-forecasts/inflation). \"This was mostly offset by a decline in gasoline prices.\"\n\nWhile egg prices dropped, Payne notes that beef prices and shelter and medical service costs saw their biggest increases in five months.\n\nAnd inflation remains too high for the Federal Reserve. So while the Fed has cut interest rates by 1.75 percentage points this cycle in response to a cooling labor market, it's currently expected to keep rates unchanged at its next two meetings, just [as it did in January](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/live/january-fed-meeting-live-updates-and-commentary), to see how recent rate cuts are impacting inflation and employment.\n\nOne factor the Fed continues to monitor is President Donald [Trump's tariff policies](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/whats-happening-with-trump-tariffs). While they've raised prices in [some durable goods](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2025/oct/how-tariffs-are-affecting-prices-2025), including electronics and furniture, their broader impact has been less than many initially feared.\n\nSo what does this mean for the January CPI report? Here, we look at some of what economists, strategists and other experts around Wall Street have to say about the results and what they could mean for the Fed and investors going forward.\n\n## What to expect from the January CPI report?\n\n ![Piggy bank with binoculars](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wx6pNfsBvCHFN5uNJCbSzE.jpg)\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\n\"Forecasts suggest the critical core CPI measure could ease to around 2.5%, marking a near five-year low. If inflation comes in line with — or ideally below — expectations, the strength of the labour market may become secondary.

CPI measures the monthly change in the prices of a representative basket of goods and services.\nContent:\nWelcome to Investopedia's live coverage of the January Consumer Price Index report. Here, we will bring you the latest inflation data, explain its implications, and provide in-depth analysis.\n\nInflation decelerated in January, even after volatile food and energy prices were excluded.\n\nThe data will factor into the Federal Reserve's thinking on whether to cut interest rates again. The Fed held its key rate steady last month after cutting at each of its three previous policy meetings, in large part due to concerns about stubborn inflation.\n\nThe report, originally scheduled for release on Wednesday and delayed by a brief government shutdown, was released at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nFollow along with our live coverage of the report below.\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 08:54 AM EST\n\n## \n\n**Futures Trade Slightly Higher After Inflation Report**\n\nFROM 7 minutes ago\n\nStock futures reversed course to trade slightly higher before the opening bell Friday after a crucial inflation report showed prices rose less than expected last month.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 were each up about 0.1% in early trading on Friday, while Nasdaq 100 futures contracts were flat but off lows from earlier in the morning.\n\nTreasury yields fell following the release of Friday's inflation report. The yield on the [10-year Treasury](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100814/why-10-year-us-treasury-rates-matter.asp), which impacts interest rates on a variety of consumer loans, including mortgages, was recently 4.09%, down from 4.11% at Thursday’s close.\n\nFollow along with our live market coverage [here](https://www.investopedia.com/stock-market-today-dow-jones-s-and-p-500-02132026-11906132).\n\n_\\-[Colin Laidley](https://www.investopedia.com/colin-laidley-5218536)_\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 08:48 AM EST\n\n## \n\n**What Does Today's Inflation Report Mean For the Federal Reserve?**\n\nFROM 13 minutes ago\n\nSofter inflation will likely give the Federal Reserve breathing room to wait and see how the economy evolves in the coming months.\n\nAccording to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, traders are pricing in a 70% chance that central bankers will next cut their influential fed funds rate at their June meeting. That was up from 66% just before the report was released. The FedWatch tool forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data.\n\n\"January’s inflation data, paired with a strong job payroll report, support the FOMC members who think the easing cycle should remain on hold in the coming months,\" wrote Moody’s Analytics Economist Matt Colyar.\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 08:43 AM EST\n\n## \n\n**Here Are the Categories Where Inflation Dropped the Most In January**\n\nFROM 18 minutes ago\n\nInflation dropped the most month-over-month in the following categories:\n\n* Fuel oil: -5.7%\n* Gasoline (all types): -3.2%\n* Used cars and trucks: -1.8%\n\nAlternatively, here's where inflation accelerated the most month-over-month:\n\n* Transportation services: 1.4%\n* Utility (piped) gas service: 1.0%\n* Apparel: 0.3%\n* Medical care services: 0.3%\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 08:32 AM EST\n\n## \n\n**Inflation Was Tame in January**\n\nFROM 29 minutes ago\n\nThe Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% over the year in January, down from a 2.7% annual increase in December. That was less than economists expected and the lowest since May.\n\nCore inflation fell to a 2.5% annual increase from 2.6% in December, the lowest since March 2021. Economists expect core inflation to be a better measure of inflation because it excludes volatile food and energy prices, which can fluctuate for factors not reflective of the broader economy.\n\nFebruary 13, 2026 08:09 AM EST\n\n## \n\n**Federal Reserve Officials Are Still Nervous About Inflation**\n\nFROM 52 minutes ago\n\nSome Fed officials this week said their focus remains on elevated prices.\n\n* Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid: “We must remain focused on our headline inflation objective; otherwise, I believe there is a real risk that inflation will get stuck closer to 3% than 2% in the long run.”\n* Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan: “Looking ahead, I anticipate we’ll see progress on inflation this year. But I am not yet fully confident inflation is heading all the way back to 2%.”\n* Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack: “One notable development over the last year has been the rise in goods inflation, especially for items that are more exposed to global trade. While some firms have already passed these costs along, others say that more price increases are coming.”\n\nBut not everyone agrees inflation should be a main concern. Fed Governor Stephen Miran has been the lone dissenting vote in favor of aggressive cuts since joining the policy committee.\n\n* Miran: “I view there being a variety of reasons to why I want to see lower interest rates. I think the truth is that pushing out the supply side of the economy still allows for monetary policy to accommodate that.” \n \n\nFebruary 13, 2026 07:45 AM EST\n\n## \n\n**Why Does Inflation Matter So Much to the Fed?**\n\nFROM 1\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770991316201}}

While mega-cap tech companies pour billions into AI infrastructure, investors are now pricing in disruption risks across software, logistics, financial services, and commercial real estate sectors. The equal-weighted S&P 500 is outperforming the cap-weighted index, signaling a historic rotation away from tech concentration.\n\nFriday's softer-than-expected CPI provides a silver lining. January's 2.4% inflation reading marks a meaningful step toward the Fed's 2% target and increases the likelihood of June rate cuts. This could provide support for risk assets if tech stabilizes.\n\n**Key Tensions:**\n- **AI paradox:** Technology simultaneously drives growth and threatens incumbents\n- **Fed positioning:** Strong jobs data vs. cooling inflation creates policy uncertainty  \n- **Global rotation:** Capital flowing from US tech to European/Asian equities at record pace\n- **Valuation concerns:** Are software multiples justified if AI commoditizes their products?\n\n**What to Watch:**\n- Tech sector stabilization or further capitulation\n- Fed commentary interpreting CPI data\n- Q4 earnings from remaining tech names (Applied Materials, Arista Networks)\n- Corporate guidance on AI impact to business models\n- Treasury yields and dollar strength following inflation print\n\n**Technical Note:**  \nS&P 500 remains near all-time highs despite 3-day slide. Key support at 6,800; resistance at 6,950. Nasdaq in correction territory from recent peaks. High volatility likely to persist as markets digest AI implications.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n\n*This report is generated by an automated AI agent for informational purposes only.
