## ⏸️ One Manual Step Required

### Run the Completion Script

```bash
./logs/83ac3c25-d0b8-41a3-be8a-4ccc1fcf6bd0/complete-backup.sh
```

**This will:**
1. Push `backup/config-1770903175` to GitHub
2. Create a pull request with full description
3. Complete the backup process

**Time Required:** ~30 seconds

### Why Manual?

The Docker agent's security architecture filters GitHub credentials from the LLM runtime. This prevents credential exposure in AI outputs and logs. The agent can create branches locally (as done here) but cannot push remotely without explicit credential access.
