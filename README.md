# thepopebot

**Autonomous AI agents. All the power. None of the leaked API keys.**

---

## Why thepopebot?

**Secure by default** — Other frameworks hand credentials to the LLM and hope for the best. thepopebot is different: the AI literally cannot access your secrets, even if it tries. Secrets are filtered at the process level before the agent's shell even starts.

**The repository IS the agent** — Every action your agent takes is a git commit. You can see exactly what it did, when, and why. If it screws up, revert it. Want to clone your agent? Fork the repo — code, personality, scheduled jobs, full history, all of it goes with your fork.

**Free compute, built in** — Every GitHub account comes with free cloud computing time. thepopebot uses that to run your agent. One task or a hundred in parallel — the compute is already included.

**Self-evolving** — The agent modifies its own code through pull requests. Every change is auditable, every change is reversible. You stay in control.

```

You talk to your bot on Telegram (or hit a webhook). The Event Handler creates a job branch. GitHub Actions spins up a Docker container with the Pi coding agent. The agent does the work, commits the results, and opens a PR. Auto-merge handles the rest. You get a Telegram notification when it's done.

## Get FREE server time on Github!

| | thepopebot | Other platforms |
|---|---|---|
| **Public repos** | Free. $0. GitHub Actions doesn't charge. | $20-100+/month |
| **Private repos** | 2,000 free minutes/month (every GitHub plan, including free) | $20-100+/month |
| **Infrastructure** | GitHub Actions (already included) | Dedicated servers |

You just bring your own [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/).

---

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Install |
|-------------|---------|
| **Node.js 18+** | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **npm** | Included with Node.js |
| **Git** | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |
| **GitHub CLI** | [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com) |
| **ngrok*** | [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/download) |

*\*ngrok is only required for local development. Production deployments don't need it.*

### Three steps

**Step 1** — Fork this repository:

[![Fork this repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fork_this_repo-238636?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/stephengpope/thepopebot/fork)

> GitHub Actions are disabled by default on forks. Go to the **Actions** tab in your fork and enable them.

**Step 2** — Clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/thepopebot.git
cd thepopebot
```

**Step 3** — Run the setup wizard:

```bash
npm run setup
```

The wizard handles everything:
- Checks prerequisites (Node.js, Git, GitHub CLI, ngrok)
- Creates a GitHub Personal Access Token
- Collects API keys (Anthropic required; OpenAI, Groq, and [Brave Search](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/keys) optional)
- Sets GitHub repository secrets and variables
- Sets up Telegram bot
- Starts the server + ngrok, generates `event_handler/.env`
- Registers webhooks and verifies everything works

**After setup, message your Telegram bot to create jobs!**
