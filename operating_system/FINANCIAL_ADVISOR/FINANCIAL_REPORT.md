## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Mixed Sentiment on Strong Jobs Data:** Wednesday's better-than-expected January jobs report initially boosted markets but gains faded as traders recalibrated Fed rate-cut expectations. The 130,000 jobs added (more than double estimates) reduced March rate cut probability from 20% to just 5-6%. However, job growth remains concentrated in healthcare (124,000 jobs) and construction (33,000), with other sectors showing weakness.

**Labor Market Uncertainty Persists:** Despite January's strength, the broader picture remains murky. 2025's massive downward revisions (only 181,000 jobs vs 1.4M in 2024) and ongoing layoffs at major corporations (Amazon, UPS) suggest caution. Fed officials face a challenging balancing act between stabilizing labor markets and managing inflation.

**Friday's CPI Critical:** With strong jobs data potentially delaying rate cuts, Friday's inflation report becomes pivotal. A hot CPI reading could further push out rate cut expectations; cooler inflation would provide relief and support the case for mid-year easing.

**Global Divergence:** Asian markets are outperforming, driven by AI/semiconductor strength and attractive valuations. European markets hit records on strong earnings (Legrand, Hermes) and M&A activity (Schroders). This contrasts with U.S. software sector weakness amid AI disruption fears.

**Sector Rotation Continues:** Investors are rotating from AI-disrupted software stocks into cyclical beneficiaries (industrials, data center infrastructure, semiconductors) and defensive assets (gold up 74% YoY).

**Key Risks:** Software sector contagion, persistent inflation limiting Fed flexibility, corporate layoffs accelerating, and geopolitical tensions (U.S.-China trade negotiations ongoing).
