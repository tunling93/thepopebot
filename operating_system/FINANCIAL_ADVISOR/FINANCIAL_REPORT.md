## 🔍 Analysis & Outlook

**Market Theme: AI Disruption Panic Meets Inflation Relief**

Thursday's brutal selloff reflects a fundamental reassessment of AI winners and losers. While mega-cap tech companies pour billions into AI infrastructure, investors are now pricing in disruption risks across software, logistics, financial services, and commercial real estate sectors. The equal-weighted S&P 500 is outperforming the cap-weighted index, signaling a historic rotation away from tech concentration.

Friday's softer-than-expected CPI provides a silver lining. January's 2.4% inflation reading marks a meaningful step toward the Fed's 2% target and increases the likelihood of June rate cuts. This could provide support for risk assets if tech stabilizes.

**Key Tensions:**
- **AI paradox:** Technology simultaneously drives growth and threatens incumbents
- **Fed positioning:** Strong jobs data vs. cooling inflation creates policy uncertainty  
- **Global rotation:** Capital flowing from US tech to European/Asian equities at record pace
- **Valuation concerns:** Are software multiples justified if AI commoditizes their products?

**What to Watch:**
- Tech sector stabilization or further capitulation
- Fed commentary interpreting CPI data
- Q4 earnings from remaining tech names (Applied Materials, Arista Networks)
- Corporate guidance on AI impact to business models
- Treasury yields and dollar strength following inflation print

**Technical Note:**  
S&P 500 remains near all-time highs despite 3-day slide. Key support at 6,800; resistance at 6,950. Nasdaq in correction territory from recent peaks. High volatility likely to persist as markets digest AI implications.
